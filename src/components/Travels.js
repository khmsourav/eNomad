            Always a wanderer at heart, I have been traveling the world since a very young age. I have always dreamt of visiting every country and hope to achieve that goal someday. Ut enim ad minim veniam,Always a wanderer at heart, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible.
